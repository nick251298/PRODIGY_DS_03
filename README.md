# PRODIGY_DS_03
 
Traffic Accidents Data Analysis Project

Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a traffic accidents dataset, using Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and geographic plotting. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of accident trends over time and locations.

Project Structure

The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (T3.ipynb) containing 27 cells, which include code and markdown sections. Below is a summary of the key steps in the analysis:

1. Environment Setup
   
Libraries Used: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and folium are installed and imported for data manipulation, visualization, and geographic plotting.
3. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded using pandas and basic preprocessing is performed to handle missing values, filter the data, and sample a subset for analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization of the distribution of accidents across different variables such as time, location, and accident severity.
Correlation analysis between various features in the dataset to understand relationships.
5. Geographical Analysis

Using folium, accident locations are plotted on an interactive map to visualize accident hotspots and distribution across different regions.
6. Results and Insights

The notebook concludes with insights on the traffic accident trends, accident severity analysis, and geographical hotspots.
